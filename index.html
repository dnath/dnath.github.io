<h2>Hello, World !</h2>

<p>
Hi, I'm <strong>Dev</strong>. I work at Google. My interests are
distributed system infrastructure, performance monitoring and large-scale
machine learning platforms.
To keep it short and simple, I'm a <strong>Software Craftsmith</strong> ...
half <em>Java Junkie,</em> half <em>C++ worshipper</em> and (sic:)
one-third <em>Pythonista</em> with a dash of <em>Ruby.</em>

</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>

<p>
Dev is a Software Engineer at
<a class="red_glow" href="https://www.google.com">Google,</a>
based out of Mountain View, California. He works on system scalability and
performance improvements for Google Shopping Ads serving infrastructure.

He earned his MS degree in Computer Science in 2015 from the
<a class="red_glow" href="{{ site.ucsb_cs_url }}">CS Dept.</a> at the
<a class="red_glow" href="{{ site.ucsb_url }}">University of California,
Santa Barbara. At UC Santa Barbara, he worked at the
<a class="red_glow" href="{{ site.ucsb_racelab_url }}">RACE Lab</a>
advised by
<a class="red_glow" href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~ckrintz/">Prof. Chandra Krintz</a>
and <a class="red_glow" href="https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~rich/">Prof. Rich Wolski.</a>
on <a class="red_glow" href="https://www.stochss.org">StochSS</a>.

StochSS was a NIH funded project whose aim is to provide an integrated
development environment (IDE) for running discrete stochastic simulations of
biochemical networks and population systems in cloud computing environments.
Dev's chief contribution was a generic cloud computing framework
for configuring virtual machines and deploying arbitrary scientific simulation
programs in the cloud (public or private) by wrapping the source code as
a web service.

Dev also has been a software engineering intern
<a class="red_glow" href="https://www.appfolio.com">AppFolio</a>, a SaaS
startup, focused on property management vertical.
At Appfolio, he worked on their data analytics team for property
rental price prediction.
</p>

<p>
Prior to Google and UCSB, he worked at McAfee on enterprise data protection
products, which included transparent enforceable encryption of files
and removable media.
