    abstract = {Fingerprint Recognition is one of  the  research hotspots in Biometrics. It  refers to the automated method of verifying a match between two human fingerprints.  It is essentially a challenging pattern recognition problem where two competing error  rates: the False Accept Rate (FAR) and the False Reject Rate (FRR) need to be minimized. Advancement of computing capabilities led to the development of Automated Fingerprint Authentication Systems (AFIS) and this led to extensive research  especially in the last two decades. In this paper, we attempt to give a comprehensive scoping of the fingerprint recognition problem and  address its major design and implementation issues as well as  give an insight into its future prospects.}
